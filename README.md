### What is Computer Science?

Computer Science is not just about programming. Rather, it's about
understanding how computer works and how to communicate with them. 

In my opinion, computer science can be divided in 9 subfields:
1. Programming
2. Computer Architecture
3. Algoritms and Data Structures 
4. Maths for CS
5. Operating Systems
6. Computer Networking
7. Databases 
8. Languages and Compilers 
9. Distributed Systems

### Computer Science and my data science degree

In my data science degree, I don't have time to see all those fields. We
mostly focus on mathematics, data science and machine learning. As a result,
I want to learn the basic of the computer science subject not covered by my
degree.

As I see it, my learning process should revolve around 4 axis: 
1. Maths, data science and machine learning from my degree
2. Computer science
3. Data Science specialization
4. Others non tech stuffs

### What I'll need to learn

| Data Science Degree | Computer Science | Specialization | Others |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ------ |
| * Maths             |                  |                |        |
| *                   |                  |                |        |
