### What is Computer Science?

Computer Science is not just about programming. Rather, it's about
understanding how computer works and how to communicate with them. 

In my opinion, computer science can be divided in 9 subfields:
1. Programming
2. Computer Architecture
3. Algoritms and Data Structures 
4. Maths for CS
5. Operating Systems
6. Computer Networking
7. Databases 
8. Languages and Compilers 
9. Distributed Systems

- CS 4 Free: https://www.cs4free.com/


### Part 1: Programming

	[to do]
	
	Checklist:
	- Data types: char, int, string, bool, float, double , long
	- Basics: 
		1. Conditional: if/else, boolean conditions
		2. loops: for, while, do while
		3. Functions
		4. Exceptions: try/catch
	- Object Oriented;
		1. Encapsulation
		2. Inheritance
		3. Polymorphism
		4. Abstraction
		5. Interface
	- Differenciating programming languages:
		1. Low-level vs High-level: manage pointers?
		2. Compilers vs Interpreters: source code into machine code or actions?
		3. Dynamic Typing vs Static Typing: space allocations
		4. Weak vs Strong Typing: type checking at run time?
		5. Paradigm: 
			1. Imperative vs Functional: Instructions precised or concepts?
			2. Procedural vs object-oriented: how code is separated?
