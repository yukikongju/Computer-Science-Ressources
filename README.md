### What is Computer Science?

Computer Science is not just about programming. Rather, it's about
understanding how computer works and how to communicate with them. 

In my opinion, computer science can be divided in 9 subfields:
1. Programming
2. Computer Architecture
3. Algoritms and Data Structures 
4. Maths for CS
5. Operating Systems
6. Computer Networking
7. Databases 
8. Languages and Compilers 
9. Distributed Systems
